These files are no longer being use. They are a Object Oriented (prototype) approach to manipulating the paragraphs/lines. They are being kept unless I ever need to revist/reintegrate them in the near future. Yes, I understand that I can just look at the github commit logs, but I'd rather have them in my IDE for now. These files should be removed once I am certain that they are no longer needed.
